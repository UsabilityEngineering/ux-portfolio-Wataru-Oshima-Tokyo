# First Journal Entry...

I would like to focus on the Touch bar of the Macbook pro in this Journal. Apple has already decided to remove this feature from the latest version of the Macbook pro. Apple cites a variety of reasons for this, including cost and production line issues. So let's take a closer look at whether this is really an unnecessary feature.
First of all, the touch bar is an LCD, and the alignment can be changed according to the user's preference, and it can also be changed to function keys. This is a very **effective** and **useful** feature. And since each key is displayed as an icon, it is **memorable** and **learnable**. However, because it is a liquid crystal display, it is undeniably very fragile in terms of **safety**, for example, it may break due to bugs caused by software errors or impact. I personally feel that physical buttons are much easier to use than LCD. First of all, the Touchbar is very prone to mis-pressing, and I have experienced many times when the key I wanted to press was not the one that I intended to press. Also, because it is an LCD, it is easy to get dirty and you have to be careful about damage to the LCD. Therefore, in terms of satisfaction, I cannot say it is fulfilled. However, it looks cool and futuristic, so it's not all bad. However, I personally think that this part would benefit more from having physical keys than LCDs. Therefore, I personally think that Apple's decision is the right one.
