I would like to focus on the Touch bar of the MacBook pro in this Journal. Apple has already decided to remove this feature from the latest version of the MacBook pro. Apple cites a variety of reasons for this, including cost and production line issues. So let's take a closer look at whether this is really an unnecessary feature.
First of all, the touch bar is an LCD, and the alignment can be changed according to the user's preference, and it can also be changed to function keys. This is a very **effective** and **useful** feature. And since each key is displayed as an icon, it is **memorable** and **learnable**. However, because it is a liquid crystal display, it is undeniably very fragile in terms of **safety**, for example, it may break due to bugs caused by software errors or impact. I personally feel that physical buttons are much easier to use than LCD. First of all, the Touchbar is very prone to mis-pressing, and I have experienced many times when the key I wanted to press was not the one that I intended to press. Also, because it is an LCD, it is easy to get dirty and you have to be careful about damage to the LCD. Therefore, in terms of **satisfaction**, I cannot say it is fulfilled. Although it looks cool and futuristic, which means it's not all bad, I personally think that this part would benefit more from having physical keys than LCDs. Therefore, I personally think that Apple's decision is the right one.
	Then let me talk about the actual task to do that a user potentially does step by step. I set the task that is to change the brightness of the screen. As you can see in the touch bar, there are some possibilities that a user gets confused. For example, the second and third buttons seem like they are the buttons to change the brightness of the screen but also the sixth and seventh buttons seem like a user can change some brightness. so a user might mistakenly touch the seventh button to try to change the brightness of the screen but actually, that is the button to change the brightness of the background light of the keyboard but since there is no indication of the buttons, there is no way to choose the correct one at a glance. The userâ€™s potential behavior could be 1) take a look at the touch bar and see the alignment 2) since the user wants to change the brightness of the screen so search for the button 3) there are some possibilities to choose it so a little confused 4) the user chooses the seventh from the right since the user is not sure the difference. 5) the user accidentally changes the brightness of the background light of the keyboard 6) then the user realizes he/she chose the wrong one. 7) and the user pushes the right one.
