The Mac home screen looks very sophisticated compared to Windows and it fulfills customer’s ***satisfaction***, 
not that Windows is particularly bad, but the Mac is more concerned with icon design, font design, etc., perhaps based on a ***heuristic evaluation***, making it easier for anyone to see and ***memorize*** . For example, if you want to check Bluetooth or Wifi, you can click on the icons at the top of the screen, and if you want to change your Macbook's settings, you can ***intuitively*** select the gear icon at the bottom of the screen. This is very ***effective*** and ***efficient*** for the user. In the past, home computers often came with thick manuals that were ***not very easy to learn*** and use and took a lot of time to get used to. However, Apple's products are designed to be ***as simple and easy to learn*** as possible, and from the start, they are characterized by the fact that they do not require manuals.
	However, this is not necessarily the case for everyone, and it can be inferred that people who originally used Windows may find it very difficult to use. For instance, the following ***scenario*** can better express what I have described above.
George, now 23 years old, started working as a web designer for an app after graduating from college. He had been using Windows throughout his school years, but the PC provided by his company was a Macbook, and he needed to get used to it. On his first day at work, he decided to try out a few things on his Macbook to get used to it. He first looked at the home screen, which seems more ***intuitive*** than Windows. He didn't have to look up the meaning of the icons, as each one had its own unique characteristics. In his mind, he thought this would be ***efficient*** and quick to learn. But the problem was he didn't immediately understand where the folders were. This was because the names of each were slightly different on Macbook and Windows. He clicked on the Mac icon to see what was where, but that only opened his Macbook’s settings screen, which did not help him locate what he was looking for. He eventually got a general feel for it after a day of struggling, but realized that being ***intuitive*** and ***learnable*** does not necessarily help with transitions from one operating system to another.
