If you look at the keyboard on my laptop, you will see that it is slightly different from a regular keyboard. This is a Japanese-style keyboard with the same alphabetical arrangement, but symbols and other special characters are placed in different places. This is not limited to Japan but is optimized for those who use them in each language area. Now, then, if you look closely at the keyboard, you will see that Japanese characters are arranged in addition to the English alphabet. This is useful for us Japanese to **efficiently** write sentences in our own language. But it is not **memorable** for us because the alignment of Japanese and English is way different so most Japanese people use the English alphabet and convert it to Japanese. But it could be **learnable**. Generally speaking, the alignment of this keyboard is said that it is optimized for human beings to be able to type quickly and **effectively**. And having some special characters are also **useful** when we need to type, for example, email addresses or arithmetic equation. If I made a scenario, it would be like that a Japanese man named “Kenjiro” wants to learn about touch-typing in English and Japanese so he bought a MacBook pro with a Japanese keyboard. He thought it is convenient to learn the alignment for both languages. All the alignment is common to others, which is very **useful** so once he got the alignment, he would use any keyboard very **efficiently**. However, he realized that it is good enough to memorize the alignment of the English alphabet because he can convert to Japanese, so it is not **necessarily memorable**. But he still has a will to memorize the Japanese alignment because he can type Japanese very **effectively**.
